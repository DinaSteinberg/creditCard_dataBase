# creditCard_dataBase

This database was created as a group project for a data bases class. It demonstrates proficiency in SQL through the creation of a database ans stored procedures, as well as a document of queries. 

Our database keeps track of CreditCards and everything that has to do with them - Purchases, Payments, Fees, Vendors, etc. The stored procedures help to normalize the data and keep all tables in sync.

This project helped solidify all the information that I learned throughout the class. It helped me realize that I can write a functional database from a list of requirements. I hope to be able to put my databases skills to use in the future.
